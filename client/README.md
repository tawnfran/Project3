# Save the Date 

Our application is intended for a user who needs a one stop shop for managing a long list of guests for their wedding. 
Keeping track of guests who are attending, cannot attend, and have not RSVPâ€™d can be tricky. Our mission is to simplify this process. 


# Design
 React application that allows users to manage their wedding guest list through a MySQL database. Once guests names and attedance status are added to the database, the application will conditionally render the data on our guests page. 

# Technologies Used
React 
Passport 
MySQL
Sequelize
Node.js
Axios
Javascript, HTML, CSS

# Future Development - A Note from the Dev Tean
Our goal is to implement a stronger front end for our app so that users can use the front end to manage their guests. Additionally, we plan to use web scraping to create a registry management page where users can create, add, and edit their registry.
